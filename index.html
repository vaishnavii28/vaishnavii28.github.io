                                    <li>The objective was to use statitical analysis to identify the key parameters of Chronic Kidney Disease upon which this model can be used a screening tool to identify patient's risk for CKD</li>
                                    <li>A dataset with patient demographics and clinical parameters of around 8000 patients was cleaned to address null values and ouliers</li>
                                    <li>The issue of class imbalance was addressed by stochastic sampling method</li>
                                    <li>Logistic Regression was then used to identify key variables that contribute to the development of Chronic Kidney Disease</li>
                                    <li>Since recall of the model was more important than accuracy and precision, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to pick the right threshold for probablity</li>

                                    <br><br>
                                    <li>Dataset – The target class of dataset was imbalanced and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique was used to balance the dataset </li>
                                    <li>Data Transformation – Regularized L1 Logistic Regression (LASSO Regression) algorithm was used for variable reduction, reducing the number of variables from 707 to 90 </li>
                                    <li>Data Model – Machine Learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ridge Regression and Model Stacking were used to develop “Propensity to Respond” Model to predict the likelihood of consumer behavior at VWWare</li>
                                    <li>Model Evaluation - Micro-Average F-Score was used as an evaluation metric and XGBoost had 100% Micro-Average F-Score. Therefore, XGBoost was used to create the “Propensity to Respond” Model</li>
